About maptool
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maptool was developed for analysis of a set of difference Fourier electron density maps from time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) experiments on bacteriorhodopsin. 
The 3D maps are represented in 1D, to aid interpretation on where and when structural changes occur, by the following:
  - Difference electron density within a sphere around every atom in the resting state structure is extracted 
  - The average positive and negative densities over the sphere are calculated for each map, with or without a sigma cut-off
The resulting dual amplitude function may be plotted along the trace of selected atoms or used for further analysis.

The uploaded set of scripts give an example for analysis of three maps (16 ns, 760 ns and 1.725 ms). 

Scripts:
- process_maps.sh	
	Translates maps to cartesian coordinates
	Converts cartesian map files to h5 format
	Saves information on map dimensions etc.

- map_to_h5.py (used in process_maps.sh)
	Used for conversion from map to h5 format

- maptool_bR.m
	The main script that performs all calculations and plots the dual amplitude functions 

To run the analysis:
- Download the files and change the path to the "maptool" directory within the scripts
- Execute process_maps.sh 
- Open matlab and run maptool_bR.m

Comments on using the tool on other datasets:
- process_maps.sh
	If all angels are already 90 degrees, remove the conversion to cartesian coordinates.
	If a map is not covering the atoms of interest including a border to cover the spheres it may be extended using mapmask BORDER.

- maptool_bR.m
 	Maps from different experiments may have different grid dimensions and different resting state pdbs. The script may be rewritten to load a new grid and/or pdb for each map.
